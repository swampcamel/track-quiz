# _Personality to Coding Track Quiz_

#### _Quiz Site to Help Determine Users What Language to Learn, 08/03/2018_

#### By _**Dan Mace**_

## Description

_This site was created to explore branching concepts in JavaScript through an interactive form.  It utilizes HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4.1.3, jQuery and JavaScript, and Google Fonts API.  The site contains a series of hidden divs for each question and the result screen.  Clicking the NEXT buttons hides the current div and reveals the following question's div.  These divs are all contained within a form element.  The final question button is a submit type and runs the script that will take the values entered in the form, create a tally based off the values, and then compare the totals collected in order to determine what child div is shown on the final result div. _

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _To view page, visit https://swampcamel.github.io/track-quiz/ ._
* _To access repository, visit https://github.com/swampcamel/track-quiz ._
* _To run site offline, clone repository.  Open index.html in the root directory of cloned repository in your preferred browser._
* _IMPORTANT: If attempting to run site offline, you will need to change links and scripts in HEAD of index.HTML to local resources for Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery for site to function the same as with CDN integration.  To use Google Fonts offline, read Google's documentation on the process._

## Known Bugs

_In one version of the script before the final commit, I attempted to use jQuery fade methods to switch between the windows and determined that stacking fadeIn and fadeOut on divs that would share the same view area doesn't work with the way I have it set up, so I reverted to the standard show/hide methods and the addClass removeClass methods used in the results screen._
