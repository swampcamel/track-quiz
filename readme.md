#### By _**Dan Mace**_

## Description

_This site was created to explore branching concepts in JavaScript through an interactive form.  It utilizes HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4.1.3, jQuery and JavaScript, and Google Fonts API.  The site contains a series of hidden divs for each question and the result screen.  Clicking the NEXT buttons hides the current div and reveals the following question's div.  These divs are all contained within a form element.  The final question button is a submit type and runs the script that will take the values entered in the form, create a tally based off the values, and then compare the totals collected in order to determine what child div is shown on the final result div. _
